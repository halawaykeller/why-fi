Fixing the old to build the new. We aim to help our youth get the necessary access to technology that can pull them from poverty. The world changes, fast, and those without the means to learn from the wealth of 
information on the internet are at a disadvantage. Our project takes old technology, refurbishes these devices and makes them
available to those that are desperate for knowledge. We have a three step program:

-Donors collect their old devices, fill out a simple form, and deliver those devices to local repair organizations.
-These organizations use their expertise to refurbish these devices.
-The refurbished devices are then made available to local non-profits for distribution to those in need.

We programmers are testaments to what is possible with just a laptop and internet. The earlier those in poverty are 
introduced to technology, the more of a chance they can stop the poverty cycle in their community.
